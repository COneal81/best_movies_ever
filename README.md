# BestMoviesEver
Welcome to the Best Movies Ever Ruby gem!  This gem provides a CLI to view the top 100 movies of all time, as per the website Rotten Tomatoes.  Once a movie is selected, it will return the movie's TV rating, genre, and the description.  To experiment with the code, run `./bin/best-movies` for an interactive prompt. I hope you enjoy this gem and look forward to your feedback. ~ Kari
